# PitchPerfect

This is my first project from Udacity course.
I was learning on UI, recording sound and how to play around with sound engine.

STEP:
1. Open application
2. Tap on record button
3. Tap on button again to save record then application will show playback view with 6 features
4. Try to play on those features.
